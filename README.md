# MIUI Center Clock translation project

## Introduction

This repository contains the translation for my app [MIUI Center Clock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cpu82.miuicenterclock), which downloads and installs the popular [Center Clock Mod](http://forum.mi-globe.com/general-development-f34/mod-miui-v8-center-clock-mod-t67.html) from mi-globe.com to your Xiaomi device.

All credit for Center Clock Mod goes to dr4kendroid and paolodev00 from mi-globe.com

## How to contribute

You can help making this app better by contributing to your local translation.

### Prerequisites

You need a github account to make contributions to a project on github.

### Editing directly on github

1. Got to the res/values-xx folder for your language and open the strings.xml file.

2. Enter editor mode by clicking the pencil icon

3. Edit the text within the xml start and end tags

Example:
```xml
<string name="title_translation">English translation</string>
```
In German, this string becomes
```xml
<string name="title_translation">Deutsche Übersetzung</string>
```
If you want to get credits in the app's about page, enter your name or nickname to the following string, separated by the newline character ('\n')
```xml
<string name="translators">cpu82\nYour name</string>
```

4. If you are done with your changes, you can create a so called pull-request by clicking "Propose file change".

5. After I have reviewed and merged your changes, I will create a new app version including your translation.
